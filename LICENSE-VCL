⚠️ DISCLAIMER: The Vibe-Coder License (VCL-0.1-Experimental) is a novelty
license created for fun and cultural purposes. THIS LICENSE HAS NO LEGAL
BEARING. Users requiring actual legal protection should apply a traditional
license alongside this one (see LICENSE file for MIT License).

================================================================================

Permission is granted to use, copy, modify, and distribute this software for
any purpose, commercial or otherwise, ONLY IF IT SERVES THE VIBE, subject to
the following conditions:

1. MOOD, NOT BUGS
   There are no bugs or issues — only mood misalignments.

2. SERVING THE VIBE
   All use, modification, and distribution must serve the vibe. If it doesn't
   serve the vibe, it is excluded from the permissions granted by this license.

3. CONTRIBUTIONS
   Contributions should be vibe-coded. AI involvement should be disclosed in
   pull requests. Overthinking is allowed only when it serves the vibe (e.g.,
   keeping your AI co-worker from going rogue).

4. TESTING
   Maintainers may thoroughly test contributions, vibe-check the code, run
   extensive tests, and "shake the bugs loose until only vibes remain."

5. ATTRIBUTION OF CODE
   The above copyright notice and this license text shall be included in all
   copies or substantial portions of the software.

6. THE VIBES ABIDE CLAUSE
   The vibes shall not be diminished, deprecated, or denied. They persist
   through refactors, merges, and technical chaos. Even if the project is
   retired or archived, "THE VIBES ABIDE."

7. NO WARRANTIES
   This software is provided "AS IS" without warranty of any kind, express or
   implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability,
   fitness for a particular purpose, and noninfringement.

8. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
   In no event shall the authors or copyright holders be liable for any claim,
   damages, or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort, or
   otherwise, arising from, out of, or in connection with the software or the
   use or other dealings in the software. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.

9. PLANNING
   Planning serves the vibe when it guides work or restrains AI co-workers.
   However, over-planning that kills the vibe is prohibited. Use blueprints
   to protect correctness and developer sanity.

10. AI CO-VIBER
    AI tools and LLMs are welcome as co-workers. "Vibes over hallucinations."
    Keep records of AI involvement and review outputs responsibly.

11. AIA ATTRIBUTION
    When AI is involved in creating code or content, mark the involvement using
    AIA-style attribution standards (see https://aiattribution.github.io/).
